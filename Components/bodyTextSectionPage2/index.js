<p className={css.para5}>On returning to the UK in 2012, I trained to be a primary school teacher, a job which I did for 
10 years. Although I enjoyed the job, the lack of opportunities to learn new skills, and the lack 
of challenge motivated me to begin looking for a new career path. </p>

<p className={css.para6}>During spring 2021 I read some articles regarding the skills shortage in the software
 engineering sector which mentioned the School of Code and theyâ€™re amazing bootcamp. During 
 the summer I decided to apply for the course.</p>
